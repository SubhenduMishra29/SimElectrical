Creating a console program in C++ that utilizes Flex and Bison for keyword recognition can be a powerful way to implement custom command parsing and execution. Here's a basic outline of how you can approach this:

Define Grammar: Start by defining the grammar for your console commands. Decide what keywords and syntax you want to support.
Write the Flex Lexer (.l file): Use Flex to create a lexer that tokenizes input from the console. Define rules to recognize keywords and other tokens in your grammar.
Write the Bison Parser (.y file): Use Bison to create a parser that interprets the tokens generated by Flex according to your grammar. Define rules for parsing commands and executing them.
Integrate with C++ Code: Write C++ code to handle the execution of commands parsed by the parser. This code will be called by Bison actions when commands are recognized.
Build and Test: Compile your Flex and Bison files to generate the lexer and parser code, then build your C++ program. Test it with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.
