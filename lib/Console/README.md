Creating a console program in C++ that utilizes Flex and Bison for keyword recognition can be a powerful way to implement custom command parsing and execution. Here's a basic outline of how you can approach this:

Define Grammar: Start by defining the grammar for your console commands. Decide what keywords and syntax you want to support.
Write the Flex Lexer (.l file): Use Flex to create a lexer that tokenizes input from the console. Define rules to recognize keywords and other tokens in your grammar.
Write the Bison Parser (.y file): Use Bison to create a parser that interprets the tokens generated by Flex according to your grammar. Define rules for parsing commands and executing them.
Integrate with C++ Code: Write C++ code to handle the execution of commands parsed by the parser. This code will be called by Bison actions when commands are recognized.
Build and Test: Compile your Flex and Bison files to generate the lexer and parser code, then build your C++ program. Test it with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

Project Directory:
Contains the top-level CMakeLists.txt file, which serves as the entry point for configuring the entire project.
Includes a subdirectory named console.
console Directory:
Contains the specific files related to the console program.
Includes its own CMakeLists.txt file for configuring and building the console program.
Contains lexer.l and parser.y files, which define the Flex lexer and Bison parser specifications, respectively.
Includes a main.cpp file, which likely contains the main entry point and logic for the console program.
This structure allows for a modular organization of the project, with separate directories for different components. The console directory specifically houses all files related to the console program, including its lexer, parser, and main source file. Each directory contains its own CMakeLists.txt file, allowing for independent configuration and building of individual components.
